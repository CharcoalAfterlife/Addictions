The first way of addiction is quantity.
We can simulate this with drugs and apples.
Let's try to do that with 2 variables.
Q is equal to the quantity.
D is equal to the death rate.
So, we will provide the stats for the apple and the drug. 

Apple States:
D = 0%
Q = 2

Drug Stats:
D = 85%
Q = 32


We can make a grid for it's outcomes.
If a food has a low Q and low D, it is eating that food rarely.
If a food has a low Q and a high D, it will lead to a healthy life due to having some/none of that food. But, having some of that food might affect the body.
If a food has a high Q and a low D, the person will have a healthy life.
If the food has a high Q and a high D, the person will die in a short time.
