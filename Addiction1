The first way of having addictions is being so used to it.
We can simulate this with drugs and apple.
We can use variables to run the simulation.
First Variable is Q. Q is equal to the the quantity of having it.
The second is T. T= Time passed.
The Third is D. D= Death Rate. That is how many health he will lose per year.
The Last is L. L is the limit for health to stay.
So:

If Q<L:
H= H-D*T.
